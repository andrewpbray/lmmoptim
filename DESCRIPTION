Description: An implementation of the optimization algorithm described in,
    "Approximately Exact Calculations for Linear Mixed Models" by Lavine and
    Hodges (2015).  The algorithm finds arbitrarily precise bounds on the
    global min/max of the restricted likelihood of linear mixed models with two
    variances. Also included are functions to visualize the likelihood function
    and the optimization process.
